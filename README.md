## Shakespeare API interface

### Prompt
Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the chops to finish out the UI. That’s where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare’s API. The design of the application is up to you.

### Application
I have built a simple app to filter and view the reviews.  The reviews can be filtered by author, rating, and published date.  The user can also press a button to display a scatterplot of the reviews currently on the filtered table.  

### Setup
 - Clone this repository
 - run `npm i`
 - run `npm start` to run the dev server
 - run `npm test` to run the tests
 - run `npm run build` to build the prod files and js bundle
